## Overview

[Stockfish][website-link] is a **free and strong UCI chess engine** derived from
Glaurung 2.1 that analyzes chess positions and computes the optimal moves.

Stockfish **does not include a graphical user interface** (GUI) that is required
to display a chessboard and to make it easy to input moves. These GUIs are
developed independently from Stockfish and are available online. **Read the
documentation for your GUI** of choice for information about how to use
Stockfish with it.

See also the Stockfish [documentation][wiki-usage-link] for further usage help.

## Files

This distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:

  * [README.md][readme-link], the file you are currently reading.

  * [Copying.txt][license-link], a text file containing the GNU General Public
    License version 3.

  * [AUTHORS][authors-link], a text file with the list of authors for the project.

  * [src][src-link], a subdirectory containing the engine source code.

  * [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt), the fixed-target Linux build.

  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE
    evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.

### Donating hardware

Improving Stockfish requires a massive amount of testing. You can donate your
hardware resources by installing the [Fishtest Worker][worker-link] and viewing
the current tests on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].

### Improving the code

In the [chessprogramming wiki][programming-link], many techniques used in
Stockfish are explained with a lot of background information.
The [section on Stockfish][programmingsf-link] describes many features
and techniques used by Stockfish. However, it is generic rather than
focused on Stockfish's precise implementation.

The engine testing is done on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].
If you want to help improve Stockfish, please read this [guideline][guideline-link]
first, where the basics of Stockfish development are explained.

Discussions about Stockfish take place these days mainly in the Stockfish
[Discord server][discord-link]. This is also the best place to ask questions
about the codebase and how to improve it.

## Compiling Stockfish

This branch targets **Linux on the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D only**. It uses
`-march=znver5`, including AVX-512, VNNI, VBMI2, BMI2 and POPCNT unconditionally.
There are no architecture switches, ARM/NEON implementations, universal binaries
or runtime CPU dispatch. Do not run the binary on a CPU without these features.

Install CMake 3.25+, Ninja, and either GCC 14+ or Clang 19+. From the repository root:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build --parallel 2
./build/stockfish
```

The default build is Release with link-time optimization. To use Clang, configure
a separate directory with `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`. Standard CMake Debug
builds remain available; they do not change the fixed instruction set.

CMake validates the default network's SHA-256 filename prefix and embeds it into
the binary. It uses a valid network from `src/` when available, otherwise downloads
it into the build directory over verified HTTPS. Network download failures or
invalid hashes stop configuration. The validated network remains beside the
executable for export tests.

```sh
cmake --build build --target bench
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

The instrumented tests require Python 3 and `requests`; they download the Syzygy
test data on their first run. The signature test must produce **1556650** nodes.
The longer existing perft and reproducibility checks require `expect` and can be
run from `build/` using `bash ../tests/perft.sh` and `bash ../tests/reprosearch.sh`.

CI build and execution tests use a self-hosted runner labelled
`ryzen-9800x3d`, with the tools above installed, for GCC/Clang Release builds and
a Clang Debug build with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
The workflow is limited to this
branch's pushes and manual runs so it does not execute untrusted pull requests on
your machine. Cross-platform release/test workflows have been removed.

Our upstream wiki documents the [UCI commands][wiki-uci-link]; its general build
instructions do not apply to this branch.

## Terms of use

Stockfish is free and distributed under the
[**GNU General Public License version 3**][license-link] (GPL v3). Essentially,
this means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program,
including distributing it among your friends, making it available for download
from your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger
software package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of
your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in some way,
you MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a pointer to
where the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary you are
distributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must
also be made available under GPL v3.
